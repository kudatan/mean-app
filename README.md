2. Go to the root folder of the project
3. Use `npm install` in root folder. Then use `cd client` and `npm install` too
4. Start the project (two options - frontend only or backend and frontend together).
- first version (fronted only). In the environment files replace baseUrl with https://mean-app-six.vercel.app. 
Then go to the `cd client` folder and use `npm run start`
